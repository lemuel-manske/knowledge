OpenAPI Specifications provide a formal standard for describing HTTP APIs.

This allows people to understand how an API works, how a sequence of APIs work together, generate client code, create tests, apply design standards, and much, much more.

Services don't work alone. They often need to call other services to get their job done. OpenAPI Specifications can be used to describe these interactions, making it easier to understand and manage complex systems.
