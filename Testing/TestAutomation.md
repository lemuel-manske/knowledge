# Test Automation

Test automation is different from [[Testing]].

Test automation is mainly used to *reduce risk*. Of course, it also helps to understand the SUT & improve software quality, but the main goal still is to reduce risk.

Many kinds of testing techniques exist, under very different contexts. [[xUnitTestPatterns]] describes a number of patterns from a unit testing perspective, for instance. That book
introduces a lot of useful insights and how-tos for unit testing.
