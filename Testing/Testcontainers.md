> A library for using Docker containers in JUnit tests

Testcontainers is a Java library that provides a convenient way to use Docker containers in JUnit tests.

That's a pretty simple description, but it has a lot of implications. It means that you can write tests that depend on external services (like databases, message brokers, etc.) without having to set up those services manually. Instead, you can use Testcontainers to spin up the necessary containers for your tests and tear them down afterward.

Nowadays, testcontainers are not limited to Java platform, proving it's usefulness in other languages as well.
