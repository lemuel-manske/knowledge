# Architecture Decision Record

ADRs are documents that capture important architectural decisions made during the development of a software system. They provide context, reasoning, and consequences of decisions to help future developers understand the architecture and its evolution.

Most of the values that ADRs brings are aimed to future developers & of cource, current team members.

While we comment in our code to give oversight of it, ADRs are meant to give a higher level oversight about architectural concerns that are not easily captured in code comments.

A good ADR will capture consequences of a decision, positives & negatives, the context in which the decision was made, and any alternatives that were considered (!).
